                  <p>Since today was my third day volunteering at the vaccination center in my city I now 
                      qualify for the vaccine. I received my first dose of the vaccine after my shift, 
                      I am excited to having this pandemic behind us. Even though I enjoy volunteering 
                      I am currently behind on some assignments for my TDGE 100 class so before I can 
                      volunteer again I will need to catch up on my work and be able to keep up moving 
                      forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Today I also met with my scene partner for TDAC 110. We got some great ideas for
                      the circumstances of the scene, we will have to run some ideas through the professor
                      but if we are allowed to do all of our ideas we will have a great scene to record.
                  </p>
 
                  <p>
                      Because today was abusy day with the volunteering, class, and meeting up with my 
                      scene partner I was not able to start my math homework until 7. One of the problems 
                      took a long time so I only was able to do 3 problems out of the 7. Because of this I
                      also was not able to continue to work on my CSE 110 lab for this week.

                    <p>
                        During TDAC 110 my scene partner and I played Draw Something to research our
                        characters background for our scene. Since this class starts at the same time as
                        my math class, I have to skip my math class which means that I have to take notes
                        for the leacture that I missed. I was not able to do this today.
                    </p>

                        For TDGE 100 we received an assignent for next week. The assignment is to find a 
                        biography of a leader to read this quarter. With this assigment I continue to fall 
                        behind in this class. Since most of our assigments do not have set deadlines I 
                        prioritize the assignments for my other classes.

                            With this entry I will have finished part 1 of my CSE 110 lab. I will try to 
                            finish part 2 tonight. This will hopefully free up enough time for tomorrow 
                            for me to catch up on my TDGE 100 homework.
